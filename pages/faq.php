                            Concrete is a composite material used extensively in construction.
                            It's made by mixing cement, water, and aggregates (which include sand, gravel, or crushed stone).
                            Once mixed, it‚Äôs poured into forms, where it sets and hardens over time to become incredibly strong and durable.

                        Concrete gets its gray color primarily from the Portland cement in the mix. 
                        Cement acts as the binder that holds everything together, and it's naturally gray due to the ingredients and processes used to make it.

                            Cement is actually just one ingredient in concrete.
                            Cement is a fine powder made from limestone, clay, and other materials. 
                            When mixed with water, it forms a paste that hardens as it dries.
                            Concrete is a composite material made from cement + water + sand + gravel or crushed stone. 
                            The cement acts as the glue that binds everything together.
                            So, cement is to concrete what flour is to bread ‚Äî a key ingredient, but not the whole thing.
